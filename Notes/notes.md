## ðŸ“˜ React Explained in Simple Language

### âœ… What is React?

* React is a **JavaScript library** for building **fast and smooth web apps**.
* It creates **Single Page Applications (SPA)** where the page **doesn't reload** on every action.
* On the first visit, all code is downloaded once, then only the required parts are updated using React.

---

### âœ… Core JS vs React

* **Core JS** uses **Imperative Programming** â†’ You tell the browser exactly how to update the UI.
* **React** uses **Declarative Programming** â†’ You describe what UI should look like, and React does the work.

---

### âœ… React Basics

* **Component-based architecture** â†’ Reusable building blocks (buttons, navbars, etc).
* **SPA (Single Page Application)** â†’ One HTML file, no full reloads.
* **JSX** â†’ HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript (converted to `React.createElement()` by Babel).

```js
// Without JSX
const heading = React.createElement("h2", {}, "Hello World");

// With JSX
const heading = <h2>Hello World</h2>;
```

---

### âœ… Rendering in React

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

---

### âœ… Babel

* Babel is a tool that **converts JSX** into `React.createElement()` so browsers can understand it.

---

### âœ… React Component

* A **React component** is a function that returns JSX:

```js
function MyComponent() {
  return <h2>Hello</h2>;
}
```

* Itâ€™s a **reusable piece of UI**.

---

### âœ… Hooks (Special Features in React)

#### 1. `useState()`

* For storing and updating values in a component.

```js
const [mood, setMood] = useState("happy");
```

#### 2. `useRef()`

* For referencing DOM elements or storing mutable values that donâ€™t cause re-render.

```js
const inputRef = useRef(null);
```

#### 3. `useEffect()`

* Runs after the component renders. Used for data fetching, updating document title, etc.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component rendered");
}, []);
```

---

### âœ… Virtual DOM vs Browser DOM

#### Browser DOM:

* Every time state changes, **entire DOM may update** â†’ **slow**.

#### Virtual DOM:

* React creates a **virtual copy of DOM** â†’ compares with old version â†’ updates only what changed.

---

### âœ… Reconciliation

* Process of comparing old Virtual DOM and new Virtual DOM.
* Finds the difference and updates the real DOM.

---

### âœ… React Fiber

* New version of Reactâ€™s core algorithm.
* Supports:

  1. Pausing/resuming rendering.
  2. Reusing finished work.
  3. Canceling unnecessary updates.
  4. Concurrent rendering.
  5. Prioritizing updates.

---

### âœ… Keys in React

* When looping over elements, always use a `key` prop:

```js
items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)
```

* Helps React **identify which items changed**, improving performance.

---

### âœ… Props

* Short for "Properties".
* Used to **pass data from parent to child components**.
* Makes components **dynamic and reusable**.

---

### âœ… Components

* Small functions that return part of the UI.
* Can be reused anywhere in the app.


 ### âœ… State vs Props

State is a local variable for a component.

It is mutable, which means it can be changed using useState().

Used for internal data management inside a component.

Props are values passed from parent to child components.

They are immutable (cannot be changed directly inside child component).

Think of props as parentâ€™s state given to child.

If needed, you can change the value by lifting the state up and modifying it in the parent.


### âœ…  Fragment

A Fragment lets you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

It is of type: Symbol(react.fragment)

You can also use: Symbol.for("react.fragment")
